Owner Start Screen: After logging in, owners can manage books and customers.
Manage Books: Add, delete, and update book information (name and price) from the inventory.
Manage Customers: Add, delete, and update customer information (username, password, points).
Logout: Securely log out from the owner's interface.

For Registered Customers:
Login Screen: Registered customers can log in using their credentials.
Customer Start Screen: Access book inventory, points, and status information.
Book Selection: Select books for purchase using checkboxes.
Buy Books: Calculate the total cost of selected books for purchase.
Redeem Points and Buy: Calculate the cost after redeeming customer points.

Data Management:
All data is stored in text files (books.txt and customers.txt) and loaded into the application upon startup.
Data is saved to the files when changes are made to the inventory or customer information.
